Description: Program takes a csv input file containing fields of a property insurance application.
It then checks if each application is complete, moving all incomplete applications to a vector for a final report.
The program then checks each application against a series of tests to determine if it qualifies to be auto accepted,
auto rejected, or is in need of review by an underwriter. Once the applications have been sorted into their appropriate
categories, the program generates three reports detailing the applications of each type.
